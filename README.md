# Domination

Hi everyone,

this is my first commercial project Domination, that is set to release probably around mid late 2021,
it is a game inspired by titles like Escape From Tarkov and Deep Rock Galactic.
As the project is still in the prototype phase I made available only the inventory system that I'm refactoring at the moment,
the one that you will be able to see here was the prototype version of it.

I will make youtube tutorials in the near future to explain everything you need to know.

I didn't put the other prototypes cause at the moment they are really messy and they would be very hard to read
for somebody else, but they will be available in the near future, most of the code of the game will be Open Source,
you can use it as you wish.

Have fun! And make great games guys!
